  <h1>Skills</h1>
  I have more then ten years of professional experience with web applications.

  For the first five years, I started out with the now obsolete JSF framework in a project for the Deutsche Telekom.
  The frontend was used to display server stock and their live status.

  For the next five years, I worked with SAP hybris, a shop system which
  provides an extensive infrastructure and a lot of features for e-commerce scenarios.
  In my next project, the technology used was the Spring Web MVC framework.
  One of my responsibilities in the project was to retrieve data from
  the backend and place that data on JSP pages and finally to style that data for display in the browser.

  In the two years during my current project I got to use Angular.
  The frontend is built with Angular and the NgRx store architecture.
  The Angular App talks to the backend via a REST API and over a web socket.
  So far I favor this architecture the most out of all things I got in contact with so far.
  It separates concerns nicely and is a modern approach that is well documented.
  Angular is a robust, component-based framework. Together with using
  Typescript, using Angular makes it possible to build well-architected applications.
